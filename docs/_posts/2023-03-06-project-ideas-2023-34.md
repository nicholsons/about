I prefer to supervise application development projects. I would welcome any suggestions you have for projects as I do not have any research projects to offer.

I have one idea which is outlined below. It lacks detail and if you are interested you will need to be prepared to think about how to solve the problem yourself.

### PGTA modelling

1. Consider the profile for CS modules such as number of students enrolled, assessment type (coursework/exam), class types (lecture, lab, tutorial), programming language or other skills needed, number of lecturers etc. Some of this data exists, other data you would need to find out yourself or determine how to deal with the NaNs. Given this data, develop a model that allows us to predict the PGTA hours for a given module (or module type) in a year, based on the predicted number of students taking the module.
2. Develop a PGTA data dashboard that will provide staff with information such as: PGTA demand versus supply; display over time the demand and supply of PGTA.

For part 1 there is no guidance about how to approach this. If you have some data analysis; statistics or machine learning background then you would ideally propose ideas for how to develop the model.

For part 3; I would prefer the dashboard to be developed using Python Plotly dash or streamlit as I would need to maintain it myself longer term.
