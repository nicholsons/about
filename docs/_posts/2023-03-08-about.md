**TL;DR** I prefer to supervise application development projects and welcome students who have their own project topic since I don't do any research.

I have a background in the technology industry in project and programme management, mainly for software development projects; and have also managed application development teams. I hold a BSc in Management Science; a PGCE in Computing Education; an MBA and an MSc in Computer Science.

I am not a research academic; so I do not have any research interests or projects. My primary interest and role is to teach. I also currently have a role in how the computer science department manages the Post Graduate Teaching Assistants (PGTAs) involved in module delivery.

I currently teach two modules of an IEP minor for engineering students: [COMP0035 Applied software engineering](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/applied-software-engineering-COMP0035) and [COMP0034 Application programming for data science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/application-programming-for-data-science-COMP0034)

I would describe myself as a generalist rather than a specialist and so know a little about quite a lot of things; rather than any one topic in depth! The modules I teach cover: Python Flask (for REST API, web apps, machine learning model deployment), Plotly Dash (data visualisation), Python, pandas, git, GitHub, PyCharm, VS Code, requirements analysis, UML, design patterns, Agile methods, database design, testing (unit tests, Selenium web driver, GitHub Actions).
